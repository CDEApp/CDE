edit the code below to pick your builder and runner, 
for :builder you can use either :MSBuilder, or :RakeBuilder
for :test_runner you can use :NSpecRunner, :NUnitRunner, or :MSTestRunner

The default behavior: specwatchr will look for a file called Rakefile.rb, if it
finds one then it will automatically set the builder to rake builder
=end

config = { :builder => :MSBuilder, :test_runner => :NSpecRunner }

config[:builder] = :RakeBuilder if File.exists? "Rakefile.rb" #specwatchr will use :RakeBuilder if it finds Rakefile.rb

@dw = WatcherDotNet.new ".", config

if you choose :NSpecRunner as your :test_runner,
this is the execution path for the NSpecRunner, the recommendation is that you install nspec via nuget: Install-Package nspec
if you do install from nuget, specwatchr will automatically find the file.
if you want to explicitly set the execution path for nspecrunner.exe, uncomment the line below
